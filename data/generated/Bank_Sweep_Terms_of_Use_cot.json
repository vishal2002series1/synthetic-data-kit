    "question": "What happens to your existing Money Market Fund shares when you enroll in Vanguard Cash Deposit?",
    "reasoning": "Step 1: According to section 1.3, when you complete enrollment into Vanguard Cash Deposit, VBS takes a specific action regarding existing Money Market Fund shares. Step 2: The text states that 'VBS will sell Your shares of Vanguard's Federal Money Market Fund (Money Market Fund) in Your Account.' Step 3: The proceeds from this sale are then transferred to the Bank Sweep program, which becomes the new default investment option for Eligible Balances. Step 4: The text also clarifies that if you still want to invest in the Money Market Fund after enrollment, you can do so by purchasing shares separately after completing the Bank Sweep enrollment.",
    "answer": "VBS will automatically sell your existing shares of Vanguard's Federal Money Market Fund and transfer the sale proceeds (net debits) to the Bank Sweep program, which then becomes your default investment option for eligible balances."

    "question": "What happens if you designate all Program Banks as ineligible to receive your funds?",
    "reasoning": "Step 1: The text explains that you can designate Program Banks as ineligible to receive your Eligible Balances and can instruct VBS to remove funds from specific Program Banks. Step 2: However, the text states a key requirement: 'You must allow funds to be swept into at least one Program Bank, subject to certain conditions.' Step 3: The text then specifies the consequence if this requirement is not met: 'Otherwise, VBS will unenroll Your Account from the Bank Sweep.' Step 4: This means that maintaining eligibility in at least one Program Bank is mandatory for participation in the Bank Sweep program.",
    "answer": "VBS will unenroll your Account from the Bank Sweep if you do not allow funds to be swept into at least one Program Bank."

    "question": "When is yield credited and paid to customers in the Bank Sweep program?",
    "reasoning": "Step 1: The text discusses yield payment timing in section 7.1. Step 2: It states that yield will be credited and paid by the Program Bank under three specific circumstances. Step 3: These circumstances are: (a) at the end of each month, (b) on the date the customer's account closes, or (c) when the customer withdraws all of their Sweep Deposits. Step 4: This means customers don't receive yield payments continuously, but rather at these defined trigger events.",
    "answer": "Yield is credited and paid by the Program Bank at the end of each month, on the date your account closes, or when you withdraw all of your Sweep Deposits."
