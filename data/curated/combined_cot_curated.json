    "reasoning": "Step 1: The text explains that private equity has sensitivity to public markets at various stages. Step 2: It specifically states that this sensitivity is 'likely greatest during the late stages of the fund's life.' Step 3: The reason given is that 'the level of equity markets around the time of portfolio company exits can negatively affect PE realizations.' Step 4: This means that when private equity funds are trying to exit their investments (which typically happens in the later stages of the fund's life), the performance of public equity markets at that time directly impacts how much money they can realize from selling their portfolio companies.",
    "answer": "Private equity's sensitivity to public markets is greatest during late stages because the level of equity markets around the time of portfolio company exits can negatively affect PE realizations, meaning poor public market conditions during exit periods can reduce the returns that private equity funds achieve when selling their investments.",
